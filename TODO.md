# TODO

- [ ] Allow guests to change RSVP from yes to no (currently no way to cancel after confirming)
- [ ] Add a comment/message field for guests (people have been using the dietary restrictions field as a workaround)
- [ ] Implement passkey-based multi-admin authentication — owner admin can generate a one-time invite link that lets someone register a passkey and become an admin
